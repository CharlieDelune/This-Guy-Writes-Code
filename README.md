## Deprecated!? Why!?

I let the thisguywritescode.com domain name expire. Less than 1 day later, I contacted my host to try and have it reinstated. It had been "reclaimed by their registrar" and the only way I could get it back was to pay an egregious "reclamation fee" as well as a higher yearly fee to keep the domain active.

So instead, I canceled my hosting package and got a new domain with a new host.
